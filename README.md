Chinese poker is a card game based on poker hand rankings. It is intended a beginner-friendly game, as only a basic knowledge of poker hand rankings is needed to get started. Additionally, the format allows for frequent unexpected outcomes, so there is a large element of luck involved, therefore a beginner has a good chance of winning in the short term, even against experienced opponents.

CHINESE POKER RULES
The rules of Chinese poker are simple if you know the rankings of poker hands.

Each player receives 13 cards.
You then arrange your hand into three different hands, two five card poker hands and one three card poker hand.
Straights and flushes don’t count in your three card hand, only high card, pairs and trips.
Your hands have to increase in strength, starting with the three card hand.
Once you’ve set your hands, you compare each of your three hands with your opponents corresponding hands, with the best hand earning a point, and a bonus point being awarded for sweeping all three.
There are also bonus points awarded to making certain hands, starting with straights on bottom and pairs higher than sixes on top. These bonus points can make the game incredibly swingy, especially if one player “fouls” their hand - fails to create three hands that ascend in value from bottom to top.
In that case the player pays the sweep bonus plus any high hand bonuses. Depending on the agreed upon bonuses, hands can get up to thirty points or higher in some cases.
The game is unlike poker in that there is no betting and there is no bluffing or hand reading. You simply play your hand and compare your results to your opponent and settle up. But the game is a lot like poker in that it contains a perfect combination of luck and skill, though this game involves considerably more luck.
